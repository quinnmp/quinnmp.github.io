<h4>FIRST Robotics</h4>
<p>
    From 5th to 12th grade, I participated in
    <strong>FIRST</strong> robotics competitions. For the first 4 years, I
    participated in <strong>FLL</strong>, which is a program for younger
    students to learn the basics of designing, building, and programming a small
    LEGO robot.<br />

    However, the most impactful experience I've had with robotics was during my
    time in high school when I joined
    <strong>FRC team 2910</strong>. In this program, students build large
    100-pound robots to compete in yearly challenges. My team was one of the
    <strong>best in the world</strong>, and I had the amazing opportunity to
    spend the 2022 and 2023 seasons as the
    <strong>lead software developer</strong>.

    On this team, I learned from talented
    <strong>mentors</strong> who are experts in their respective industries. We
    had mechanical mentors from Boeing, software mentors from Microsoft, etc. To
    see a list of skills I picked up with my time on this team, see
    <em>Skills</em>.<br />

    To see some of the software-specific awards I received in the
    context of this team, see
    <em>Awards</em>.<br />

    Here is a video of our 2022 robot performing very highly in the
    <em>autonomous period</em>, a period in which the robot runs exclusively on
    software. I wrote the code running in this video. Our bot was one of the
    only in the world that could perform this "6-Ball Auto".<br />

    Here is more autonomous work. In this video, our two robots simultaneously
    run separate autonomous periods.<br />

    In this video, our robot uses
    <strong>computer vision</strong> and <strong>PID controllers</strong> to
    automatically align with the scoring nodes. I wrote this code.<br />
