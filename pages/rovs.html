<h4>UWROV</h4>
<p>
    I am one of two software leads on the
    <a href="https://uwrov.org/"
        ><strong>Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles Team at the University of Washington</strong></a
    >. This team focuses on underwater robots and is a
    <strong>world-class team</strong> in terms of robot performance and
    documentation.<br />
    My role as a software developer on this team has largely been in the realm
    of computer vision, both in the fields of
    <strong>Structure from Motion</strong> (underwater position localization)
    and <strong>Photogrammetry</strong> (creating 3D models of the sea floor and
    structures on it). Below is an example of some of the 3D reconstruction work
    I've been doing. This image features a pipe structure used to mimick coral,
    captured from a camera mounted on the bottom of the ROV.<br />

  At the 2025 world championships, we won 3 awards -- we were the <strong>Engineering Presentation World Champions</strong>, <strong>Technical Documentation World Champions</strong>, and <strong>Sharkpedo Legacy Innovation Award winners</strong>.<br />

  In the summer of 2025, we participated in the <strong>MATE ROV / NOAA Ocean Exploration Video Challenge</strong>, an AI and CV challenge. I lead the development on this, and we ended up winning <strong>1st place</strong>, which won us a sponsored trip to the <strong>Underwater Intervention Conference</strong> to present our work.
