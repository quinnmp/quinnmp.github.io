<h4>Academics</h4>
<p>
    In my Junior year of high school, I took part in my school's
    <strong>Running Start</strong> program. I went full-time my Senior year, and
    in total, I had enough college credits to graduate with an Associate degree
    simultaneously with my high school graduation.<br />

    Additionally, I maintained a perfect
    <strong>4.0 GPA</strong> in my Running Start courses.
    This earned me the <strong>President's Distinction</strong> at Everett Community College.<br />
