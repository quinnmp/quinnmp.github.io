<h4>Awards</h4>
<h5>Robotics</h5>
<p>See
    <em>Robotics</em> for the more broad-scale statistics regarding the high performance of my high school robotics
  team. Below are achievements that I feel personally very proud of.</p>

    <strong>2022</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        Autonomous Award Sponsored by Ford (x2)
    </li>
</ul>
    <strong>2023</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        Autonomous Award Sponsored by Ford
    </li>
    <li>
        2023 IRI Scholar along with Host Teams Scholarship
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these years, I either directly developed or worked very closely with the autonomous code of our robot, and so these awards were
<strong>very closely tied to my work
    directly</strong>. Additionally, in July 2023, I was selected along with 3 other students to receive a
<strong>scholarship at the Indiana Robotics
    Invitational</strong>. This was a very high honor, and something I feel very proud of.
