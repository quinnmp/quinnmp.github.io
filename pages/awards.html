<p>Both of these years, I either directly developed or worked very closely with the autonomous code of our robot, and so these awards were
<strong>very closely tied to my work
    directly</strong>. Additionally, in July 2023, I was selected along with 3 other students to receive a
<strong>scholarship at the Indiana Robotics
    Invitational</strong>. This was a very high honor, and something I feel very proud of.
