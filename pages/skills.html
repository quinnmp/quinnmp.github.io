<h4>Skills</h4>
<h5>Courses</h5>
<p>
    I took
    <strong>Calculus 1-3</strong> along with <strong>Linear Algebra</strong> at
    Everett Community College.<br /><br />

    Additionally, I completed nearly every CS course that EvCC had to offer,
    including their most difficult,
    <strong
        >CS244 - Advanced Data Structures and Introduction to Algorithms
        Java</strong
    >. This course covered a large variety of fundamental CS topics, such as Big O
    notation, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and many other data
    structures.<br /><br />

    At the University of Washington, I have taken or am currently taking
    <strong>CSE 311, 312, 331, 332, 333, 351, 421, 442, 455, 473, 478, 546, 547</strong> (see <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/courses/">here</a> for more information). These courses cover computer vision, graduate-level natural language processing, autonomous robotics, graduate-level machine learning and artificial intelligence, low-level systems programming, advanced data structures, theoretical foundations of computing, and more. In the mathematics department, I have taken or am currently taking <strong>MATH 207, 209, 224, 300, 394</strong> (see <a href="https://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/math.html">here</a> for more information). These cover probability, differential equations, linear analysis, advanced multivariable calculus, and more.

<h5>Web Development</h5>
<p>
    I taught myself full-stack web development. I consider myself proficient in
    using tools like
    <strong
        >HTML, CSS, EJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery, React,
        Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose</strong
    >. Additionally, I have much experience in
    <strong>interfacing with APIs</strong>. See <em>Contact</em> for a link to
    my GitHub where some of my web development work is hosted.<br />
</p>

<h5>Other Hard Skills</h5>
<p>
    I am comfortable with all the above Web Development languages,
    <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>. I
    am very familiar with a wide array of
    <strong>Machine Learning concepts</strong> through my time doing Research
    with the Allen School (see <em>Research</em>!). I am also familiar using
    <strong>Linux-based operating systems</strong> including extensive
    experience with the <strong>command line</strong>. I have had
    <em>very</em> extensive in teams and in team leadership positions, and with
    that, I have gotten very comfortable managing Version Control through
    <strong>git</strong> along with <strong>Pull Request review</strong> and
    <strong>project management via GitHub</strong>.
